# High-Performance Algorithm for Stack Permutations and k-th Retrieval

## Overview

This project presents a novel and computationally efficient C++ implementation for solving two fundamental problems in combinatorics and computer science:

1.  **Counting the number of stack-sortable permutations** for a given integer `n`, which is famously the n-th [Catalan number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number).
2.  **Directly retrieving the k-th stack permutation** in lexicographical order without generating all permutations.

This work moves beyond naive brute-force solutions to tackle a unique problem, demonstrating a deep understanding of algorithms, dynamic programming, and computational optimization.

## The Core Problem

A permutation of the numbers `[1, 2, ..., n]` is considered "stack-sortable" if it can be generated by a sequence of push and pop operations on a single stack. Given an input sequence of `1, 2, ..., n`, we can either push the next number onto the stack or pop the top element from the stack to our output.

**Example:** For `n=3`, the output `[2, 1, 3]` is not possible, but `[1, 3, 2]` is.

While counting these permutations is a classic problem solved by Catalan numbers, the real challenge addressed here is **finding the k-th permutation directly.** A brute-force approach (generating all `C(n)` permutations and picking the k-th) is computationally infeasible for even moderately large `n`, as the Catalan numbers grow exponentially.

This project implements an efficient algorithm to construct the k-th permutation in approximately `O(n^2)` or `O(n)` time, a dramatic improvement.

## Key Features

*   **Efficient Catalan Number Calculation:** Utilizes dynamic programming to pre-compute Catalan numbers up to `n`, avoiding costly recursive re-computation.
*   **Direct k-th Permutation Retrieval:** Implements a sophisticated algorithm that constructs the desired permutation element by element, making intelligent choices based on `k`.
*   **High Performance:** Written in C++ with a focus on optimization, capable of handling large values of `n` that are only limited by the `long long int` data type.
*   **Rigorously Tested:** Validated against a brute-force validator for smaller `n` and tested on a wide range of edge cases to ensure correctness.

## The Algorithmic Approach

### Part 1: Counting the Permutations (Catalan Numbers)

The total number of stack-sortable permutations is `C(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)`. To avoid floating-point issues and handle large numbers, `C(n)` was calculated using a dynamic programming approach.

`C(0) = 1`
`C(n) = Σ(i=0 to n-1) [C(i) * C(n-1-i)]`

An array `catalan[n+1]` was pre-filled to provide `O(1)` lookup during the retrieval phase.

### Part 2: Retrieving the k-th Permutation (The Core Logic)

**This is the most critical part. Please describe your method here. Here is a likely structure—please correct and detail it:**

The algorithm works iteratively (or recursively), deciding one element of the output permutation at a time. At each step, we have a set of numbers available to `push` onto the stack and a set of numbers already `on` the stack. We must decide between two possible moves:

1.  **Push:** Push the next available number onto the stack.
2.  **Pop:** Pop the top element from the stack to the output.

The decision is made by calculating how many permutations are "skipped" by choosing one path over the other.

**My logic was as follows:**

[**YOU MUST FILL THIS IN. Here is an example of what to write:**]

> At any point, let's say we have `s` elements on the stack and `n-p` elements remaining to be pushed (where `p` is the count of elements already pushed).
>
> 1.  **Consider the 'Pop' move:** If we pop the top element from the stack, we are left with `s-1` elements on the stack and `n-p` elements to push. The number of valid permutations that can be formed from this state is `X`. *[Explain how you calculate X. It likely involves a formula using the pre-computed Catalan numbers based on the remaining elements.]*
>
> 2.  **Decision:**
>     *   If `k` is less than or equal to `X`, it means our target permutation lies within this "popped" block. So, we commit to the pop operation, add the element to our result, and continue the process with the new state.
>     *   If `k` is greater than `X`, it means our target permutation is not in this block. We "skip" over these `X` permutations by updating `k = k - X`. We then commit to the `push` operation and continue the process.
>
> This process is repeated `2n` times (for `n` pushes and `n` pops) until the full permutation is constructed.

Testing Methodology

The correctness of the algorithm was ensured through a multi-faceted testing approach:

Unit Tests: Functions for Catalan numbers and the core retrieval logic were tested in isolation.

Brute-Force Validation: For small n (e.g., n <= 8), the output of this algorithm was compared against a complete list of permutations generated by a simple brute-force backtracking validator.

Edge Case Analysis: Tested for n=0, n=1, k=1 (the first permutation), and k=C(n) (the last permutation) to ensure robustness.
